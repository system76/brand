## Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                | Discription |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Pop!_Blue | ![#48b9c7](https://via.placeholder.com/10/48b9c7?text=+) #48b9c7 | This vibrant blue rivals our Curiosity_Orange. Like our hardware and software, the friendly competition between these colors sharpens both of their wits. Pop!_Blue represents vast possibilities, potential, and freedom. |
| Curiosity_Orange | ![#ffad00](https://via.placeholder.com/10/ffad00?text=+) #ffad00 |  System76 likes to explore new territory, and the name certainly reflects that. Curiosity is derived from the Mars Science Laboratory space probe mission, which collected data from Mars to prepare for a human mission. Warm, friendly, and assertive, Curiosity contradicts the cold-color norm for tech companies. |
| Terra_Grey | ![#574f4a](https://via.placeholder.com/10/574f4a?text=+) #574f4a | A happy marriage between grey and brown, this warm neutral welcomes the curious and capable makers of tomorrow to Linux with open arms. Its earthy tone breathes reliability and longevity into our branding, establishing trust and loyalty with our users. |
| Lumen_Yellow | ![#f7e062](https://via.placeholder.com/10/f7e062?text=+) #f7e062 | Our disposition is bright as the sun, so we chose a bright yellow to match. Lumen_Yellow provides a cheerful retro aestheticâ€”it makes us feel likea kid in a candy store or an astronaut on the bridge to a rocket. Nerdy aspirations begin with a childlike enthusiasm for all things science, as evidenced by our Star Trek lunch boxes; Lumen_ Yellow instills that enthusiasm into our brand. |
| Discovery_Midnight | ![#102a4c](https://via.placeholder.com/10/102a4c?text=+) #102a4c | This navy blue symbolizes the deep mysteries of the Great Unknown we are constantly working to understand. STEM and creative work is about exploring areas of thought where no one has gone before. Discovery_Midnight promotes this existential journey into the mind while providing contrast to our brighter colors. |
