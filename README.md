## Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                | Discription |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Pop!_OS Blue | ![#52B3B8](https://via.placeholder.com/10/52B3B8?text=+) #52B3B8 | This vibrant blue rivals our Curiosity_Orange. Like our hardware and software, the friendly competition between these colors sharpens both of their wits. Pop!_Blue represents vast possibilities, potential, and freedom. |
| Curiosity_Orange | ![#EDA53C](https://via.placeholder.com/10/EDA53C?text=+) #EDA53C |  System76 likes to explore new territory, and the name certainly reflects that. Curiosity is derived from the Mars Science Laboratory space probe mission, which collected data from Mars to prepare for a human mission. Warm, friendly, and assertive, Curiosity contradicts the cold-color norm for tech companies. |
| Terra_Grey | ![#4E4841](https://via.placeholder.com/10/4E4841?text=+) #4E4841 |
